### Tasks vs threads
Threads and tasks are used for different problems. Threads have more to do with latency. Tasks, on the other hand, focus on throughput, where many operations are executed in parallel.

#### Management
With tasks, the programmer decides what can be run in parallel in principle and the system then decides at runtime what will be run in parallel. Internally, this is achieved by the work-stealing queues, where tasks are redistributed among the available processors dynamically.

## Three ways of avoid the most vexing parse in concurrency

1. Add an extra pair of parentheses
2. Use copy initialization
3. Use uniform initialization with braces

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

class Vehicle
{
public:
	// Pass data to the thread function
	Vehicle(int id) : _id(id) {}
    void operator()()
    {
        std::cout << "Vehicle object has been created \n" << std::endl;
    }
};


int main()
{
    // create thread 
    //std::thread t0(Vehicle()); // C++'s most vexing parse
    
    std::thread t1( (Vehicle(1)) ); // Add an extra pair of parantheses
    
    std::thread t2 = std::thread( Vehicle(1) ); // Use copy initialization
    
    std::thread t3{ Vehicle(1) };// Use uniform initialization with braces

    // do something in main()
    std::cout << "Finished work in main \n";

    // wait for thread to finish
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    t3.join();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Lambdas
C++-Lambdas have the properties of being unnamed and capturing variables from the surrounding context, but lack the ability to execute and return functions.

A lambda is a functor, so it has a type and can be stored and passed around. Its result object is called a "closure", which can be called using the operator `()`.

A lambda consists of three parts: a capture list `[]`, a parameter list `()`, and a main part `{}`.

By default, variables in the capture block can not be modified within the Lambda. Using the keyword `mutable` allows to modify the parameters captured by copy, and to call their non-const member functions within the body of the Lambda.

Even though we have been using Lambdas in the above example in various ways, it is important to note that **a Lambda does not exist at runtime**. The runtime effect of a Lambda is the generation of an object, which is known as _closure_. The difference between a Lambda and the corresponding closure is similar to the distinction between a class and an instance of the class. A class exists only in the source code while the objects created from it exist at runtime.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int id = 0; // Define an integer variable

    // capture by reference (immutable)
    auto f0 = [&id]() { std::cout << "a) ID in Lambda = " << id << std::endl; };

    // capture by value (mutable)
    auto f1 = [id]() mutable { std::cout << "b) ID in Lambda = " << ++id << std::endl; };
    f1(); // call the closure and execute the code witin the Lambda
    std::cout << "c) ID in Main = " << id << std::endl;

    // capture by reference (mutable)
    auto f2 = [&id]() mutable { std::cout << "d) ID in Lambda = " << ++id << std::endl; };
    f2(); 
    std::cout << "e) ID in Main = " << id << std::endl; 

    // pass parameter 
    auto f3 = [](const int id) { std::cout << "f) ID in Lambda = " << id << std::endl; };   
    f3(++id);

    // observe the effect of capturing by reference at an earlier point in time
    f0(); 

    return 0;
}
```

Programers need to take special care when capturing local objects by reference because a Lambda’s lifetime may exceed the lifetime of its capture list: **It must be ensured that the object to which the reference points is still in scope when the Lambda is called**. This is especially important in multi-threading programs.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

int main()
{
    int id = 0; // Define an integer variable

    // starting a first thread (by reference)
    auto f0 = [&id]() {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
        std::cout << "a) ID in Thread (call-by-reference) = " << id << std::endl;
    };
    std::thread t1(f0);

    // starting a second thread (by value)
    std::thread t2([id]() mutable {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(50));
        std::cout << "b) ID in Thread (call-by-value) = " << id << std::endl;
    });

    // increment and print id in main
    ++id;
    std::cout << "c) ID in Main (call-by-value) = " << id << std::endl;

    // wait for threads before returning
    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    return 0;
}
```

#### Passing arguments using a variadic templates
The thread constructor may be called with a function and all its arguments. That is possible because the thread constructor is a _variadic template_ that takes multiple arguments.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <string>

void printName(std::string name, int waitTime)
{
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(waitTime));
    std::cout << "Name (from Thread) = " << name << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    std::string name1 = "MyThread1";
    std::string name2 = "MyThread2";

    // starting threads using value-copy and move semantics 
    std::thread t1(printName, name1, 50);
    std::thread t2(printName, std::move(name2), 100);

    // wait for threads before returning
    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    // print name from main
    std::cout << "Name (from Main) = " << name1 << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Name (from Main) = " << name2 << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <string>

void printName(std::string &name, int waitTime)
{
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(waitTime));
    name += " (from Thread)";
    std::cout << name << std::endl;
}

int main()
{
    std::string name("MyThread");

    // starting thread
    std::thread t(printName, std::ref(name), 50);

    // wait for thread before returning
    t.join();

    // print name from main
    name += " (from Main)";
    std::cout << name << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

#### Starting threads with member functions
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

class Vehicle
{
public:
    Vehicle() : _id(0) {}
    void addID(int id) { _id = id; }
    void printID()
    {
        std::cout << "Vehicle ID=" << _id << std::endl;
    }

private:
    int _id;
};

int main()
{
    // create thread
    Vehicle v1, v2;
    std::thread t1 = std::thread(&Vehicle::addID, v1, 1); // call member function on object v
    std::thread t2 = std::thread(&Vehicle::addID, &v2, 2); // call member function on object v

    // wait for thread to finish
    t1.join();
    t2.join();

    // print Vehicle id
    v1.printID();
    v2.printID();

    return 0;
}
```

Use a `std::shared_ptr<T>` to ensure that the object lives as long as it takes the thread to finish its work.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

class Vehicle
{
public:
    Vehicle() : _id(0) {}
    void addID(int id) { _id = id; }
    void printID()
    {
        std::cout << "Vehicle ID=" << _id << std::endl;
    }

private:
    int _id;
};

int main()
{
    // create thread
    std::shared_ptr<Vehicle> v(new Vehicle);
    std::thread t = std::thread(&Vehicle::addID, v, 1); // call member function on object v
    
    // wait for thread to finish
    t.join();
    
    // print Vehicle id
    v->printID();
    
    return 0;
}
```

#### Fork-join parallelism
1. Split the flow of execution into a parallel thread ("fork")
2. Perform some work in both the main thread and the parallel thread
3. Wait for the parallel thread to finish and unite and split flow of execution again ("join")

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>
#include <random>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    // create threads
    std::vector<std::thread> threads;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
    {
        // create new thread from a Lambda
        threads.emplace_back([i]() {

            // wait for certain amount of time
            std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(10 * i));

            // perform work
            std::cout << "Hello from Worker thread #" << i << std::endl;
        });
    }

    // do something in main()
    std::cout << "Hello from Main thread" << std::endl;

    // call join on all thread objects using a range-based loop
    for (auto &t : threads)
        t.join();

    return 0;
}
```

 Thread objects do not have a copy ctor and thus can not be duplicated (`push_back()`). Instead, we use the `emplace_back()` and move semantics to contruct the object in-place.

## Pass data from the worker threads back to the parent thread
The sending end of the channel is called `std::promise` while the receiving end is called `std::future`. `std::promise` provides a convenient way to store a value or an exception that will acquire asynchronously at a later time via a `std::future` object.

Promises cannot be copied, because the promise-future concept is a two-point communication channel for one-time use. Therefore, we must pass the promise to the thread function using `std::move`.

In the main thread, the function `get()` will be blocked until data is available, which happens as soon as `set_value` has been called on the promise from the thread.

After `get()` has been called once, the future is no longer usable. A second call will throw an exception.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <future>

void modifyMessage(std::promise<std::string> && prms, std::string message)
{
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(4000)); // simulate work
    std::string modifiedMessage = message + " has been modified"; 
    prms.set_value(modifiedMessage);
}

int main()
{
    // define message
    std::string messageToThread = "My Message";

    // create promise and future
    std::promise<std::string> prms;
    std::future<std::string> ftr = prms.get_future();

    // start thread and pass promise as argument
    std::thread t(modifyMessage, std::move(prms), messageToThread);

    // print original message to console
    std::cout << "Original message from main(): " << messageToThread << std::endl;

    // retrieve modified message via future and print to console
    std::string messageFromThread = ftr.get();
    std::cout << "Modified message from thread(): " << messageFromThread << std::endl;

    // thread barrier
    t.join();

    return 0;
}
```

Passing exceptions:
In the catch-block, we catch the exception and throw it to the parent thread using the promise with `set_exception`. The function `std::current_exception` allows us to easily retrieve the exception which has been thrown.



```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <future>
#include <cmath>
#include <memory>

void divideByNumber(std::promise<double> &&prms, double num, double denom)
{
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500)); // simulate work
    try
    {
        if (denom == 0)
            throw std::runtime_error("Exception from thread: Division by zero!");
        else
            prms.set_value(num / denom);
    }
    catch (...)
    {
        prms.set_exception(std::current_exception());
    }
}

int main()
{
    // create promise and future
    std::promise<double> prms;
    std::future<double> ftr = prms.get_future();

    // start thread and pass promise as argument
    double num = 42.0, denom = 0.0;
    std::thread t(divideByNumber, std::move(prms), num, denom);

    // retrieve result within try-catch-block
    try
    {
        double result = ftr.get();
        std::cout << "Result = " << result << std::endl;
    }
    catch (std::runtime_error e)
    {
        std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    // thread barrier
    t.join();

    return 0;
}

```

### `std::async`
For the straightfoward task of returning data or exceptions from a worker thread to the parent thread, there is a simpler and more convenient way using `std::async()` instead of `std::thread()`.

```cpp
std::future<double> ftr = std::async(std::launch::deferred, divideByNumber, num, denom);
double result = ftr.get();
```

Note that `async` returns a future, which we will use later to retrieve the value that is returned by the function.

With `async`, we do not need to call `join()` any more, because the thread dtor will be called automatically, which reduces the risk of a concurrency bug.

`std::async` makes it possible to control the number of concurrency by passing an optional launch parameter, which enforces either synchronous or asynchronous behavior. `std::launch::deferred` enforces the synchronous execution, while `std::launch::asunc` enforce an asynchronous execution. `std::launch::any` leaves it to the system to decide the number of threads in a carefully balanced way that optimizes runtime performance by looking at the current workload of the system and the multi-core architecture of the system.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <future>
#include <cmath>
#include <memory>

double divideByNumber(double num, double denom)
{
    // print system id of worker thread
    std::cout << "Worker thread id = " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;

    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500)); // simulate work

    if (denom == 0)
        throw std::runtime_error("Exception from thread#: Division by zero!");

    return num / denom;
}


int main()
{
    // print system id of worker thread
    std::cout << "Main thread id = " << std::this_thread::get_id() << std::endl;

    // use async to start a task
    double num = 42.0, denom = 2.0;
    std::future<double> ftr = std::async(std::launch::deferred, divideByNumber, num, denom);

    // retrieve result within try-catch-block
    try
    {
        double result = ftr.get();
        std::cout << "Result = " << result << std::endl;
    }
    catch (std::runtime_error e)
    {
        std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
